    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large croissants, halved horizontally, left out overnight</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinammon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <b>Let's get cooking ðŸ”¥</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, half-and-half, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg together in a shallow bowl. Dip each croissant half into egg mixture, one at a time, flipping it and lightly pressing down, until well coated. </li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; add four croissant halves, cut-side down. Fry until browned on both sides, turning once, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the oven to keep warm while you cook the remaining croissants. </li>
        <li>Serve warm with your favorite toppings. </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It's important that the croissants are dry before dipping. As an alternative to leaving the croissants sit out overnight, you can place the sliced croissants on a baking sheet, and toast in the oven at 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) until dry, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Feel free to substitute almond milk or low-fat milk for the half and half.</li>
        <li>Other topping suggestions are powdered sugar, chopped nuts, cinnamon-sugar, blueberry or strawberry syrup, and whipped cream.</li>
    </ul>
