    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Macarons are made with finely ground almonds, confectioners' sugar, and egg whites. They are the most delicious soft cookies with crispy edges. I finally perfected the technique and wanted to share it. Pipe your choice of filling or frosting on a cookie and sandwich another cookie on top.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 egg whites</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>5/3 cups confectioner's sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup finely ground almonds</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <b>Let's get cooking ðŸ”¥</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.</li>
        <li>Beat egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until foamy. Add white sugar and beat until egg whites are glossy, fluffy, and hold soft peaks. </li>
        <li>Sift confectioners' sugar and ground almonds in a separate bowl; quickly fold almond mixture into egg whites, about 30 strokes.</li>
        <li>Spoon a small amount of batter into a plastic bag with a small corner cut off and pipe a test disk of batter, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, onto the prepared baking sheet. If the disk of batter holds a peak instead of flattening immediately, gently fold batter a few more times and retest. </li>
        <li>When batter is mixed enough to flatten immediately into an even disk, spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a plain round tip. Pipe batter onto the baking sheet in rounds, leaving space between the disks. Let piped cookies stand out at room temperature until they form a hard skin on top, about 1 hour. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 285 degrees F (140 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Bake cookies in preheated oven until set but not browned, about 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Let cookies cool completely before filling, about 30 minutes. </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To measure by weight, use these amounts: 100g egg whites, 50g white sugar, 200g confectioners' sugar, and 110g ground almonds.</li>
        <li>If you do not have a sifter, you can use a blender or food processor to thoroughly mix the almonds and confectioners' sugar. Just blend or pulse for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Remember that because the consistency of the mix is like cake batter, you'll have to be quick when piping it onto the silicone mat. Hold the pastry bag sideways between piping so it doesn't spill.</li>
    </ul>
